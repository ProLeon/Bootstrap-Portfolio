                    Hello! My name is Dylan Whipple and I'm an aspiring web developer. I live in Minnesota and love it here! My personal life is laid back and I am very family oriented, spending most of my free time with them. 
                    Some of my hobbies include snowboarding, gaming, and developing games. I have always had a huge interest in computers since I got my first one when I was 12 years old. I was able to do so much on it that most nights, I couldn't find myself getting off of it.  After awhile of gaming I had stepped back from that and became really interested in coding and how that works.  I made my first fully functioning game at 14 and dabbled in fun notepad scripts to mess with my school’s computer disk trays, which I probably shouldn't have done. I also build all my own computers, which is extremely fun and surprisingly easy.
                    A little about my work history includes: starting off in retail working at Wal-Mart, then Kohls Department Stores. I had moved on from those and began traveling state to state working as a cell-tower technician, upgrading towers to LTE signal. After that, I had moved on to do security work for the Blaine Human Resource Center. Those jobs were short lived, only lasting about a year.  I then found sales in the cell-phone industry a very fun team building job, which I did for 3 years! Now I spend my free time learning to refine my ability to code.
